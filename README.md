# Wox.Plugin.OSXVolumeControl

Plugin for osx volume control.

Type Volume to active the plugin.

You can use the following commands: volume id:xx ++ (add 10% to volume), volume id:xx -- (subtract 10% from volume), volume id:xx 50 (set volume to 50%). What's more you can combine with shortcut to simplify the operation. For example, you can set the shortcut to Alt+Shift+Up to increase the volume by 10% and Alt+Shift+Down to decrease the volume by 10%.

One more thing, If you are a speaker composed of multiple speakers, you can adjust the volume simultaneously through the following command: volume id:xx:yy:zz ++/--/50. Where xx is the id of the composed speaker, yy and zz are the id of the specific speaker.
